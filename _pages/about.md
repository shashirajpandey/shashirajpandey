I received the B.E degree in Electrical and Electronics with specialization in Communication from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank"> Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal in 2013. After graduation, I served as a Network Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">Huawei Technologies Nepal Co. Pvt. Ltd</a>, Nepal from 2013 to 2016. At present, I am a Ph.D. Student at Networking Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea.

For the past few years, I am working as a researcher in wireless communications, with particular interests in network economics, game-theoretical analysis, optimization techniques enabling 5G network services, and distribued machine learning (Federated Learning). During these years, several collaborative works have helped me understand the value of knowledge sharing as a fundamental unit of a learning journey. This spirit motivated us to an 'exciting' new work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301" target="_blank">Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges</a>. This work lays out a holistic philosophy with underlying principles for building distributed and democratized machine learning algorithms, namely Dem-AI. The outlined principles provide a generalization of distributed learning beyond existing mechanisms such as federated learning. We have a short blog about this <a href="https://medium.com/@shashir101/distributed-and-democratized-learning-philosophy-and-research-challenges-4ef156ed42ca" target="_blank">here</a>.

Aside, I enjoy reading books, playing guitar whenever possible, hiking to the mountain peaks, traveling around and taking pictures. I am immensely inspired by Tom Hank's character in "Forrest Gump", and you can find me listening to Elvis Presley, Tommy Emmanuel, Jeff Buckley, Glen Hansard, John Smith, Damien Rice, Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Don McLean. Sometimes, I wander like the fireflies - tiny, but a meaningful creature, write half-done poems, loosely connected songs, and weave musical notes in them, or just listen to podcasts on life, philosophy, astronomy, biology. Sometimes, I dive into the trivial mathematical proofs, curious about how things work, I play around with the concepts, and explain myself- in an unconventional way. At least, I feel like that! I celebrate life- calm and simple- and, try my best not to define myself with a single success, or a single failure.

Let me know, I am not that boring. :)
