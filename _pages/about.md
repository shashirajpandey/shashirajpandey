I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/" target="_blank"> Department of Electronic Systems </a>, Aalborg University, and an affiliated member at the <a href="https://www.aicentre.dk/" target="_blank"> Pioneer Center for Artificial Intelligence</a>, Denmark. My current research interests are in **network economics** and **algorithmic game theory** that involves: **wireless networks** and **machine learning** for the future of communications, as the _so-called_ **semantic and goal-oriented communications**. Prior, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/sections-labs/connectivity/" target="_blank">Connectivity Section (CNT)</a>, Aalborg University, where I was fortunate to be working with <a href="http://petarpopovski.es.aau.dk/" target="_blank">Petar Popovski</a> under the Villum Investigator Grant (WATER).  

I did my PhD at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/main/index.do" target="_blank">  Kyung Hee University</a>, South Korea, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oKANWloAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">**Choong Seon Hong**</a> and <a href="https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io/" target="_blank">**Nguyen H. Tran**</a>.  My PhD thesis was on "Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Incentive Design and Game-theoretic Analysis" <font color="Red">(Best PhD Thesis Nominee)</font>. The draft thesis slides is available <a href="https://github.com/shashirajpandey/shashirajpandey.github.io/blob/gh-pages/assets/Shashi_FinalDefense.pptx">"here" </a>. I got my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank"> Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal. After graduation, I served as a Network Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">Huawei Technologies Nepal Co. Pvt. Ltd</a>, Nepal from 2013 to 2016.

I was awarded the "Nuchenarayan Ramdevi Takhache Sirapa Award" for securing the highest academic rank (S.L.C.) in the class of 2006.  In 2013, our (with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DuA7v4MAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Amar Shrestha, PhD </a>, Research Scientist, Amazon USA) undergraduate project received the "Outstanding Project Award" by  Nepal Telecom Authority (NTA). I am also the recipient of the prestigious Brain Korea 21st Century Fellowship (South Korea), Ministry of Science and I.C.T. Fellowship (South Korea), and Presidential Scholarship (Kyung Hee University, South Korea) for graduate studies. I was Member-at-Large (MaL) in the IEEE Communication Society (ComSoc) On-line Content Board (2021) and IEEE ComSoc Young Professionals (2020 - 2021). At present, I am appointed to The IEEE Spectrum Institute's Editorial Advisory Board for a three-year term (2022-2024).

For the past few years, I am working as a researcher in wireless communications, with particular interests in network economics, game-theoretical analysis, optimization techniques enabling 5G network services, and distribued machine learning (Federated Learning). During these years, several collaborative works have helped me understand the value of knowledge sharing as a fundamental unit of a learning journey. This spirit motivated us to an 'exciting' new work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301" target="_blank">Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges</a>. This work lays out a holistic philosophy with underlying principles for building distributed and democratized machine learning algorithms, namely Dem-AI. The outlined principles provide a generalization of distributed learning beyond existing mechanisms such as federated learning. We have a short blog about this <a href="https://medium.com/@shashir101/distributed-and-democratized-learning-philosophy-and-research-challenges-4ef156ed42ca" target="_blank">here</a>.

I enjoy reading books, playing the guitar whenever possible, hiking to the mountain peaks, traveling around, and taking pictures - cooking for the family, friends. I am immensely inspired by Tom Hank's character in "Forrest Gump", and you can find me listening to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Tommy Emmanuel, Jeff Buckley, Glen Hansard, John Smith, Damien Rice, John Mayer, Lisa Hannigan, Laura Marling, Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Don McLean. Sometimes, I write half-done poems, loosely connected songs and weave musical notes in them, or just listen to podcasts on life, philosophy, astronomy, biology. Sometimes, I dive into the trivial mathematical proofs, curious about how things work, I play around with the concepts, and explain myself- in an unconventional way. At least, I feel like that! I celebrate life- calm and simple- and try my best not to define myself with a single success or a single failure.

Sometimes, I wander like the fireflies - tiny, but a meaningful creature, write half-done poems, loosely connected songs, and weave musical notes in them, or just listen to podcasts on life, philosophy, astronomy, biology.
