I received the B.E degree in Electrical and Electronics with specialization in Communication from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank"> Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal in 2013. After graduation, I served as a Network Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">Huawei Technologies Nepal Co. Pvt. Ltd</a>, Nepal from 2013 to 2016. At present, I am a Ph.D. Student under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oKANWloAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Professor. Choong Seon Hong</a> at  <a href="http://networking.khu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Networking Intelligence Lab</a>, Kyung Hee University, South Korea.

For the past few years, I am working as a researcher in wireless communications, with particular interests in network economics, game-theoretical analysis, optimization techniques enabling 5G network services, and distribued machine learning. During these years, several collaborative works have helped me understand the value of knowledge sharing as a fundamental unit of a learning journey. This spirit motivated us to an 'exciting' new work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301" target="_blank"> "Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges" </a>. This work lays out a holistic philosophy with underlying principles for building distributed and democratized machine learning algorithms, namely Dem-AI. The outlined principles provide a generalization of distributed learning beyond existing mechanisms such as federated learning. We have a short blog about this <a href="https://medium.com/@shashir101/distributed-and-democratized-learning-philosophy-and-research-challenges-4ef156ed42ca" target="_blank"> "here" </a>. We are working towards its practical implementation.

Aside, I enjoy reading books, playing guitar, hiking, and travel. I am immensly inspired by Tom Hank's character in "Forrest Gump", and would be found listening to Elvis Presley, Tommy Emmanuel, Glen Handsard, John Smith, Damien Rice, Bob Dylan, Don McLean.
