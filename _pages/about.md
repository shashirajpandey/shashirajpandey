I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/sections-labs/connectivity/" target="_blank">Connectivity Section</a>, Aalborg University, Denmark, working with Professor <a href="http://petarpopovski.es.aau.dk/" target="_blank">Petar Popovski</a> at the intersection of Network Economics, Game Theory, Machine Learning and Data Markets.  


I received the B.E. degree in Electrical and Electronics with specialization in Communication from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank"> Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal. After graduation, I served as a Network Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">Huawei Technologies Nepal Co. Pvt. Ltd</a>, Nepal from 2013 to 2016. In May 2021, I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis titled "Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Incentive Design and Game-theoretic Analysis" at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea.

I was awarded the "Nuchenarayan Ramdevi Takhache Sirapa Award" for securing the highest academic rank (S.L.C.) in the class of 2006.  In 2013, our (with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DuA7v4MAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Amar Shrestha, PhD </a>, Research Scientist, Amazon USA) undergraduate project received the "Outstanding Project Award" by  Nepal Telecom Authority (NTA). I am also the recipient of the prestigious Brain Korea 21st Century Fellowship (South Korea), Ministry of Science and I.C.T. Fellowship (South Korea), and Presidential Scholarship (Kyung Hee University, South Korea) for the graduate studies. I was Member-at-Large (MaL) in IEEE Communication Society (ComSoc) On-line Content Board (2021) and IEEE ComSoc Young Professionals (2020 - 2021). At present, I am appointed as The Institute's Editorial Advisory Board for a three-year term (2022-2024). Looking forwad to contributing and learning on the way.

For the past few years, I am working as a researcher in wireless communications, with particular interests in network economics, game-theoretical analysis, optimization techniques enabling 5G network services, and distribued machine learning (Federated Learning). During these years, several collaborative works have helped me understand the value of knowledge sharing as a fundamental unit of a learning journey. This spirit motivated us to an 'exciting' new work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301" target="_blank">Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges</a>. This work lays out a holistic philosophy with underlying principles for building distributed and democratized machine learning algorithms, namely Dem-AI. The outlined principles provide a generalization of distributed learning beyond existing mechanisms such as federated learning. We have a short blog about this <a href="https://medium.com/@shashir101/distributed-and-democratized-learning-philosophy-and-research-challenges-4ef156ed42ca" target="_blank">here</a>.

Aside, I enjoy reading books, playing guitar whenever possible, hiking to the mountain peaks, traveling around, and taking pictures - cooking for the family, friends. I am immensely inspired by Tom Hank's character in "Forrest Gump", and you can find me listening to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Tommy Emmanuel, Jeff Buckley, Glen Hansard, John Smith, Damien Rice, John Mayer, Lisa Hannigan, Laura Marling, Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Don McLean. Sometimes, I wander like the fireflies - tiny, but a meaningful creature, write half-done poems, loosely connected songs, and weave musical notes in them, or just listen to podcasts on life, philosophy, astronomy, biology. Sometimes, I dive into the trivial mathematical proofs, curious about how things work, I play around with the concepts, and explain myself- in an unconventional way. At least, I feel like that! I celebrate life- calm and simple- and, try my best not to define myself with a single success, or a single failure.

Let me know about you too, I am not that boring. :)
