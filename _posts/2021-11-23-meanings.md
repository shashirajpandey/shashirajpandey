What this life is-  
A bit of what it is and what it is not;  
What it could be, but what it turned out to be.  

What means to be courageous-  
You farewell the good things and accept what you get  
when things go the other way.  
You keep the good things, but be kind to impermanence-  

You carry on for life.  

What are relationships-  
That makes your heart warm and fade away insecurities.  
You lose obligations, but be on time for each other.  

In the course of finding countless meanings to life,  
what this happiness is-  
only togetherness.
