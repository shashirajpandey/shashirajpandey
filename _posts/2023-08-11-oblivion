those, who sneak life  
out of their most humane cloak,  
grow inhuman, impatient,  
and in no time.  

such is the plight.  

as if, it is not "us"  
but one of us,
who lived the scorching sun,  
and flared subtle emotions to graze  
over their colder thoughts.  

such is the plight,  
humans,  
"what have you done",  
to all of us.
