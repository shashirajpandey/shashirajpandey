When the time will tell  
"This ground belongs to you."  
where the flames of desire have  
burned down things, you always knew.  

When the time will tell  
it was windy, and the blazing fumes  
were crawling over your face  
somehow, you couldn't see the evening sun  
making its way through; to your place.  

When the time will tell  
"Oh, the time you took to assimilate."  
your belongings will be spared,  
for the memories you have sold, to recollect  

What will you do?  
How well you'd stood?  
when the time will tell  
"not very soon."
