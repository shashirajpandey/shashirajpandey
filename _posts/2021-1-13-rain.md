The clouds becoming 'dark' from white-  
a mellow journey turned into a rage;  
full of anguish-the storms and lightning.  
What's left is a bare contemplation,  
for what it may take, and what will remain.  

The turmoils of pretending are visible.  
As the wind has left us all naked  
we see each other-our vulnerabilities;  
now shall we put an effort to feel them too?  
Somebody asked.  

We knew 'nicer things' were just another "cup of tea."  
And these subtle delusions were what makes a life.  
With no intentions to pry into someone's emotions  
we thought it was okay to ask for whatever we like.  

But, the clouds were becoming 'dark' from white.  
A mellow journey was subtly turning into a rage.  
Full of anguish, with the storms and lightning;  
and what was left there, a bare contemplation-  
for what it might take, and what would remain.
