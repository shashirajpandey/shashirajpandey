the green fields, the palates of colored leaves-  
a canvas of subtleness, a life of calm and peace;  
the floating, freely roaming clouds of myriad gestures,  
the composure and humility of butterflies  
tickling the hearts of the flowers.  

a place, where the roars of wind won't stop  
the chirping of the birds. 
where the caress of the cold breeze  
presumes the mellow daylight.  
even in the fragile, long strech of the day-  
without disguising the kindness of the nature.  

a place, where it is okay to be you  
without being the others.  

unknowingly, you carry the place you perceive.
