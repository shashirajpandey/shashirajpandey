Her smile is (her) reflection I see.  
Her presence is an emotion, taking us aback  
from the subtle loneliness that comes with age,  
and not having (her) by our side.  

(She) would have held her and  
blessed her with a gentle kiss on the forehead;  
a resemblance of an everlasting, happy fragrance,  
when the first drop of monsoon touches the soil.  

We miss (her) every moment.  
As we breathe, and so life goes by,  
(She) sees us through her eyes,  
and speaks to our hearts with warm memories.  

(She) grows older and wiser in her,  
and that expression of love is what  
keeps us secure for the rest of our lives.
