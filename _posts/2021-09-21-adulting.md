Travel rituals when adulting 
takes us to places 
we've seldom thought about.  

We make up ourselves,  
from the core of our heart  
to the edge of our conscience.  
On some occasions,  
it becomes tiresome-  
You want to stop.  

All the preparations we choose  
to decore ourselves neat  
becomes a mediocre practice.  
We think about time;  
How we trade youths  
in finding ourselves.  

All these years of adulting,  
we seek togetherness but  
lose grip on our belongings.  

Who are we becoming?  
Not just a traveller, right?
