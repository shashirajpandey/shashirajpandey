my little daughter,  
you gaze at me and speak,  
"there should be no sorrow,"  
only beautiful memories to keep.  

you gracefully spell wise words  
like the sky does to the sea,  
to settle its depth underneath,  
in the colours of rainbows to be.  

my little daughter,  
you wish us happy,  
for the chances life did offer,  
and so will I, for you.
