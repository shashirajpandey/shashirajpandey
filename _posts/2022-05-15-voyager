Years ago,  
when I decided to leave home  
and try out the rest of the world,  
I feared.  

"It's alright",  
I wish I have had said then,  
to that amateur voyager.  

The concept of time, age, and spaceâ€”  
together, wrapped up my curiosity  
with fragility and emotions.  

I learned to live with this fear;  
a repercussion of stepping out  
from "home"-familiarity, and being there -  
where you find a friend in yourself,  
eventually.
