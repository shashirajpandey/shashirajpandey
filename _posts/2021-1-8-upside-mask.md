These days,  
we don't need to pretend much.  
Like we're talking to each other-  
the way we used to;  
we all wear masks over our faces.  
But we were doing the same, don't we?  
Since the beginning of time, we know,  
"Wearing masks of prejudices,"  
every time we used to speak.  


Now, we set us all free.  
Free from the burden of formalities.  
Free from the abyss of situational relationships.  
I know some will even remove each other  
from the stories of their "good old times,"  
together.  

These days,  
it is possible.  

We don't need to pretend much  
like we really care for each other-  
the way we used to;  
We all wear masks over our faces.  
But we were doing the same, don't we?  
Since the beginning of time, we know,  
every 'kind' words were just a metaphor.  
We said what we didn't mean to say-  
carefully, our portrait of a "good person,"  
was kept.  

Now, our eyes wouldn't gaze at each other?  
Silently, like they used to,  
over our successes and failures.  
And, we can confess to each other  
that we did envy.  

Sigh! I cannot see well though  
I use both masks and glasses!
