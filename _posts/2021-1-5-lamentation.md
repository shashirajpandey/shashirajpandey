When the sky turned deep blue  
People locked themselves 'inside'-  
Contemplating the 'blue sky'.  

Some said the color resembles that of the ocean,  
Because it was stretched so far;  
Far beyond the horizon to see.  


Some said it's not even the 'sky',  
But the ocean clinging above our head;  
Waiting to drench the shades-  
In so many forms and realizations of our lives.  

One said it's not 'blue', but white.  
And because there were clouds, just before,  
Blue merely is a reflection of 'emptiness'.  


In no time, being under the open sky   
Became a redemption for many of us-  
It was there, but we were not,  
To breathe in every corner of it.
