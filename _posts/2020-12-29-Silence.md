Once, in a deserted land,  
Lived families of adults,  
In harmony with nature.  


They never felt hungry.  
They never get tired.  
All they would do was  
to protect a slender tree.  

Nobody knows who had planted  
one tree at the highest hill around;  
That single tree survived for years.  
They never seek out other places.  
They never speak to each other too.  

All they would do was  
to stay under the tree. 

The realization of day and night  
was there due to a sun-like figure.  
Hot and shinny, it would fade out   
every few hours.


They never felt sleepy.  
They were never fully awake too.   
All they would do was  
occupy the silhouettes of the tree.  

Days went by and nights.  
The members of the families  
Would look at the tree-  
a deity figure of their life.  

One day or it was one night,  
I don't remember exactly.  
The tree vanished into thin air  
From the highest hill around  
of a deserted land  
Where lived families of adults,  
In harmony with nature.  

Now, there's just silence.
