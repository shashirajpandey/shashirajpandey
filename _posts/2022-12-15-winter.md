On the cold winter days,  
they smiled,  
keeping the warmth in their hearts alive.  

I smiled, too,  
thinking of the coming spring.  

The wind whispered tales about life,  
they welcomed it with grace -  
"When things go odd, you play even",  
an act of subtle courage at the display,  
I picked it.  

Unsaid words surround us when no one.
