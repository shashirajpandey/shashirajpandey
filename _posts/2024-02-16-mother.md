Mother, you know  
my thoughts in hard times;  
when followed by the dark,  
and into the dark.  
when ran out of words,  
but an Everest of emotions to tell.  
an everlasting void and,  
a sunken heart to carry and live the rest.  

the light of your smile  
shines the way and  
cuddle all my difficulties away.  

I know you are with me.  

I take a lifelong refuge in time,  
and be with you always.  

Never gone are memories that make us,  
and only time can dispel griefs, I get.  
But, Mother, sometimes, it takes a lot,  
and I will surely find you by my side then,  
I know.
