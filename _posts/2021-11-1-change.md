I asked the birds defying the Nordic wind  
what's it like to be,  
of trying and almost failing to be still  
But then, keeping up for each other and not giving up.  

I asked the Autumn surrendering to the Winter,   
the rain making its way together;  
to a point where the day meets night   
And time stops by,  
not giving a different number anymore-  
What is this change all about?  

Some answers are experiences  
that can only be felt than said or shared.
