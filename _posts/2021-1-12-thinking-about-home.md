I then lie down, and  
feel the clouds around-  
sailing swiftly as the wind;  

With strange figures,  
faces - odd shapes they carry  
from my memory epitomes.  

I smile, thinking about time,  
home, people; you in those  
beautiful moments I've had.  

And then,  
immensely submerged in nostalgia:  
an anecdote of happiness,  
I travel back in time,  
with these clouds of thoughts.
