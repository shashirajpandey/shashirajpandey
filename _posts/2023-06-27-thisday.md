I have surrendered myself to this time,  
the best of all and the rest; I feel moved.  
what lies ahead of us is as wonderful as  
the graceful glow of fireflies;  
majestic as the Himalayas;  
as surreal as one of those narratives  
decorated by Haruki Murakami;  
a heartful canvas  
set by the bright yellow morning lights.  

is this a reality?  

words are mere arbitrations  
I took refuge with.  

they fall short in expressing the non-binaries  
emotions we safeguard for ourselves.
