If it's not that easy to acquire  
the taste of life; the circumstances;  
the situations; the boundaries;  
Altogether - at once; it's natural  
for all of us!  

Not all meanings are substantial.  
Not all indulgence is happiness. 
Not all hassles are troublesome.  
Not all companionship is love!  

The inherited chaos of overthinking  
is the reason for a pity living, and  
if I magnanimously appreciate 'time,'  
I'd have simplified my life -  
instead!
