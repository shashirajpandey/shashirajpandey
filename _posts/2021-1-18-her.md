Her voice resonates in the darkness  
of early Autumn, and the breeze that  
upholds the very imprint of her self;  
It tells me how she would look.  

One of many ways to know her would be   
to hum along with her melodies, and   
craft her silhouettes from the echoes-  
a solemn expression of love.  

Yes, I have known her like such-  
ever since the beginning of knowing myself.  
In every moment of joy and despair,  
in all seasons, always.  

"Is there a way of 'not' knowing her?"  
you may ask.  

Well,  
how to un-know the 'self' ??
